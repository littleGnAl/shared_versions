# shared_versions

[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/littleGnAl/shared_versions.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/littleGnAl/shared_versions)

shared_versions is a CLI tool that allow share the versions for multiple packages in Flutter.

## Usage
shared_versions will match the package dependencies versions from the `shared_versions.yaml` in your package by default, so make sure you have a `shared_versions.yaml` file locate in the root of the package. Note that the format of the dependencies should respect the
[Dart Package dependencies](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies). e.g.,
```yaml
# shared_versions.yaml

built_collection: 4.3.1
built_value: 7.0.8
flutter_svg: ^0.15.0
shared_versions: 
  git: https://github.com/littleGnAl/shared_versions.git
    ref: master
```

In your `pubspec.yaml`, add the following:
```
dev_dependencies:
    shared_versions: ^1.0.0
```


Then you can run:
```
flutter pub run shared_versions
```
or
```
pub run shared_versions
```

You can also specify which versions file you use by passing the `--path`/`-p` option, e.g.,
```
flutter pub run shared_versions --path your_versions.yaml
```
